A little backstory about how I got here !

During my last year of High School, I was not sure what I want to major next, so my choice of baccalaureate II should've been based on the major I want, and since I had no major planned, I decided to do a baccalaureate II in Life Sciences since it might help me go into biology related fields or fields concerning general sciences.

After I graduated, I was also not sure what I want to major but I ended up choosing Biomedical Science. Even though I was doing great during my first semester in Biomedical Science, something wasn't feeling right and I couldn't figure out what it was, until one time I saw my friend building a website, which encouraged me to learn such skills and build a web app for my family's small business. I found myself the next week spending 8 hours a day learning basic web development, and that's when I decided that I want to switch majors to computer science.

When I switched to computer science, everything changed completely, I was always showing up to class, never missing a lecture, and actually enjoying the stuff I learnt. Not only I was enjoying the Computer Science courses, but I also found a passion for Mathematics which lead me to request 2 extra-curricular math courses. My love for computer science and passion for math together made me decide to major in a field that heavily relies on both, and it was Data Science!

You might be thinking why did I major in France instead of majoring in Lebanon? Well the answer is easy and clear: France is known for its diverse pool of programs and student-friendly life, so it was very easy for me to find the major I want at the university I wanted. Not only that, but it was a one-time in a life opportunity for me that is currently giving me the chance to explor new parts of the world, different cultures, meeting new people and making new memories.

So yes that's my story, thank you for taking your time reading it!
